BeesEtAl - An implementation of the Bees Algorithm for optimisation
===================================================================

## Overview

This is intended eventually to be a suite of optimisation algorithms
mainly for research purposes. The intended use is for problems where
evaluation of the cost function is itself intensive and costly in
time, and therefore a severely restricted number of analyses is
permitted. This implementation (BeesEtAl) is unlikely to be efficient
when the number of evaluations is large, i.e., >> 10000.
